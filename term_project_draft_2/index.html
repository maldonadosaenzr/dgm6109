    <pre>hypothesis: with an increase of coffee intake: there is a decrease in sleep quality.</h5>
    <br>
    <pre></pre>the reason for this topic is because of my personal occurence of abnormal sleep
         (sleep paralisis,insomnia,etc) all of this events are more common that one may think,
          as 50% of people will
         experience sleep paralisis at least once in there lifetime;<br>
          with half of them living with it regularly.</pre>

          <pre>so seeing that for me this occurence is "random" i decided to take note of data that is concidered as 
            "starters" for this events, such as:
        
        1- coffee intake: this is devided by morning and noon coffee, as the hour makes a difference.
        2-lights off: this is refering as an hour of complete darkness before going to sleep 
        (no social media or other things that affect the REM cycle)
        3-bedtime
        4:total sleep hours
        5: what was the quality of sleep in that night (the reason why for this and not taking note of 
        "paralisis/insomnia events" is because they are rare enough to be dificult to register more than 3,
        this being an uncontrolable and unpredictable event after all, but knowing they are co-related then thats what 
        would be in concideration.)

        results:

        there is no relation.

        totaly out of what i speculated the results give that its an ""co-relation isnt equal to causation"
        as one could even say that the more coffee intake = better sleep, which shouldnt be the results, but 
        one interesting thing is that even then the "events" dont seem random, for there is a 
        sleep pattern going aprox. every 10 days of a increase of sleep quality with a suddent drop, so whether
        coffee isnt the perpretraitor of this events it does still show that something else is. whether it being 
        by the enviroment, or weekly REM activity is to still be determened.
