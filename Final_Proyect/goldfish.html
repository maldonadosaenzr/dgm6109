<h4>"These are aquarium fish that came about by selectively breeding types of crucian carp.
  It took hundreds of years to get the long tail fin and beautiful color of the current breed. 
  Even red goldfish are black when they are young and still retain some other vestiges of the crucian carp. 
  They turn red as they grow, thus gaining their much more commonly known look." </h4>
