<h3>about us</h3>

<h5> did you know that a betta fish can live up to five years? and a goldfish till fifteen! so many fishes are not taking care of and abused everyday just because
    <br>"having a fish bowl is enough"
    <br> which is wrong! as any animal they need proper care and love,our mission is to help new pet owners 
    <br> (specially the "owners by surprise") and starting aquarist to learn about the world of freshwater fishes,
    <br> having to take care of a new lil guy can be scary, but with us it can be lots less scary! 
<br>so for those that really want to have the empathy to learn and care for our little companions; welcome!</h5>
