                   <h3> here we have data from diferent areas that may affect the quality of sleep throught the night:</h3>
                     <br><h2>coffee consumption</h2>
                     <h3>this is devided between two sections; before and after noon,
                        this is because it is known that taking coffee after 12pm affects your sleep throught the night </h3>
                <br><h2>hour of lights off before bedtime</h2>
                       <h3> as it is recomended to take time off cellphones and other electronics before night i decided to take this 
                        as a data collection of taking messure of which nights just before bedtime i take an hour without screens and big 
                    headlights throught my room, making it better to fall asleep (Hypothesis)</h3>
                      <br><h2>bedtime</h2>
                      <h3> here i take note of how much time off actual sleep is taken each night by messuring the time i actually go to sleep (not
                        counting screen time) and when i wake up, for this i took note of when i set my alarm  clock.</h3>
                     <br> <h2>quality of sleep</h2>
                        <h3> in a chart of one to ten its messured the quality of sleep of each night, meaning how actually rested one feels
                            after each night (one thing to note is that is not a surprise that it is relativly similar to the bedtime data.)
                        </h3><br>
                      <br><a href="image.1.png" class="nav-main-item">sketch 1</a>
                      <h3> in this chart the x axis means the sleep quality while the y axis is
                         the coffees by day, while the colors are the 
                        diference of yes/no of an hour of no light before bedtime, that way we
                         can a clear difference betweem the information of lights, coffee and bedtime.

                <h3>here the bigest diference is the inclution of data regarding 
                    the nights that where registered as the x axis 
                    , with coffee amount being color coded and the y
                     axis being the sleep quality of the night. </h3>

                      <h3> in this chart there is a bigger enfasis throught it of the quality of sleep,
                         for the bars make quite drastic difference, the x axis is this thing exactly, 
                         while the y axis is the amounts of coffee by day and the color coding being the 
                         lights on data.</h3>
